i've done leetcode every day for 300+ days now. what started as interview prep became something else.

## the compound effect

day 1 was rough. day 100 was better. day 300? problems that seemed impossible now feel approachable.

not because i got smarter. because i'd seen similar patterns before.

## showing up

the hardest part isn't the problems. it's showing up on days you don't want to.

some days i'm tired. some days i'm frustrated. but the streak keeps me accountable.

there's something about not breaking a chain. it transforms practice from a decision into a default.

## beyond the numbers

this changed how i approach learning in general. new tech, new domain, new skill—i trust that consistent effort over time gets you there.

> we are what we repeatedly do.

the streak continues.
